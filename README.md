# MDConsole

##Introduction

The MDConsole is a feature that was added in the 2015-2016 season.  The Smartdashboard provided by FRC turned out to be unreliable and behave unpredictably.  In addition, the ability to sustomize it was very limited.  

MDConsole provides a better alternative.  It uses websockets to communicate to the robot.  It is an HTML5 application that uses modern web development techniques.  This enables advanced features, such as:
* __adaptive__ behavior - Based on the state that the robot or other factors during game play, the console can change its content and present what is most relevant to the operators at that time
* customizeable UI = The UI can be customized beyond what is achievable in the Smart Dashboard.  The full spectrum of HTML5 capabilites can be leveraged, enabling advanced visualization and custom experiences tailored to enahnce operator control
* Extensible Operator Interface - The console cna be used as an extension of the operator interface, enabling it to send commands to the robot and control its systems
